# DSA - Arrays

## üìö Overview

This repository is dedicated to the study of Arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains key concepts, techniques, common patterns, and a collection of problems to practice.

## üìö Concepts Covered

- **Array Basics**: 
  - Definition and properties of arrays.
  - One-dimensional vs. multi-dimensional arrays.

- **Key Techniques**:
  - Two-pointer technique: Efficiently traversing arrays.
  - Sliding window technique: Finding subarrays with specific properties.
  - Sorting techniques: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.

- **Common Patterns**:
  - Finding duplicates.
  - Subarray problems (e.g., maximum sum subarray).
  - Merging intervals.
  - Rotating arrays.
